            <h3>Roger Ji – President</h3>
            <p>With three years of leadership experience—including roles as Safety Captain, Treasurer, and VP of Engineering—Roger has consistently addressed the team’s operational gaps. As Treasurer, he managed a $50,000+ budget, securing critical resources while balancing team needs. Inspired by the structured mentorship and role clarity of top teams like High Tide, Cobra Commanders, and 8-Bit, Roger’s presidential focus centers on retention and technical growth. He will prioritize hands-on robot work by dedicating 50+ hours next season to structured programming and CAD training, addressing the skill shortages observed in recent years. To retain rookies, he’ll implement shadowing programs modeled after these teams’ best practices, pairing new members with veterans and assigning clear, responsibility-driven roles during builds. Roger also plans to strengthen outreach by collaborating with the I&I subteam to schedule more events and maintain consistent sponsor communication, aiming to adopt the streamlined workflows that have propelled these elite teams to success.</p>

            <h3>Lucas Flowers – VP of Engineering</h3>
            <p>As former Lead Programmer, Control Systems Lead, Treasurer, Drive Coach, and Human Player, Lucas has honed the leadership and management skills critical for the role of Vice President of Engineering & Design. His vision focuses on restructuring the team into five specialized subteams: Mechanical/Assembly for physical builds, Design for CAD prototyping, Controls for electrical systems and code, Logistics/Field for organization and competition preparation, and I&I for marketing and fundraising. To bridge skill gaps, he’ll launch a 3 week rookie bootcamp where new members rotate through subteams before shadowing veterans in their chosen subteam. Lucas will also institute weekly digital check-ins with subteam leads to review progress, troubleshoot issues, and align priorities, ensuring projects stay on track without overlaps or delays. Lucas believes that with adequate and efficient training and communication systems, the team’s productivity can flourish even more.</p>

            <h3>Andy Apodaca – Secretary</h3>
            <p>As Field Team Lead, Andy demonstrated precision in constructing competition pits and field elements, ensuring seamless setup under tight deadlines. His effectiveness as a scout—where he mastered rapid data collection and alliance negotiations using the team’s existing systems—highlighted his ability to communicate clearly and work optimally under pressure. As Secretary, he’ll apply this same disciplined efficiency to administrative tasks: just as he executed scouting and field roles without overcomplicating processes, he’ll optimize volunteer hour tracking with intuitive tools that simplify the logging process and make things more transparent. He’ll create and standardize documentation for rookies across all subteams, ensure consistency in meeting notes, build logs, and create sponsor reports that show the team where our money is coming from. Andy will also prioritize timely meeting summaries, to keep every subteam updated on the work that is being done across the whole team.</p>
